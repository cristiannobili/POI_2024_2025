                            Obiettivo di questo progetto è la realizzazione di una applicazione web che mostra un
                            insieme
                            di punti di interesse su una mappa su Flensburg.
                            Il progetto Erasmus+ contiene la realizzazione di due applicazioni web identiche nella
                            struttura,
                            uno per i luoghi di Milano (i cui contenuti saranno inseriti dagli studenti di Flensburg) ed
                            uno per Flensburg
                            (i cui contenuti verrano inseriti dagl'autori sotto citati).
                            Il layout è analogo ma con colori leggermente diversi in modo da evidenziare le due varianti
                            del progetto.

                                            Kurt-Tucholsky is a secondary school in Flensburg. Since 1993 it has had the
                                            title of “European School”. The school was founded in 1973 with a temporary
                                            location in Husby and a few years later moved to Flensburg with the modern
                                            concrete building on Richard-Wagner-Straße in green surroundings. After 17
                                            years as a so-called special school, it was only the change of government in
                                            1988 and the new school law implemented by the new SPD state government in
                                            1990 that allowed it to be classified as a normal school. At the beginning
                                            of the 2010/11 school year, Kurt Tucholsky School is officially a community
                                            school. In 1993 it was given the name Kurt Tucholsky. The initiative came
                                            from Marco Kühnert, a student at the time, in 1990/91. After long internal
                                            debates at the school, the school board decided to give the name against the
                                            declared will of the school management. The KTS currently has 1192 students
                                            in 50 classes that are divided into three school branches: the main school
                                            branch (5th - 9th grade), the secondary school branch (5th - 10th grade) and
                                            the high school branch (5th - 10th grade). The KTS offers a very wide and
                                            diverse range of foreign languages. Spanish can be chosen as a second
                                            foreign language in addition to Latin from the 7th grade. The KTS maturity
                                            corresponds to that of all other high schools in Schleswig-Holstein.

                                            The port of Flensburg is located at the end of the
                                            Flensburg Fjord (overlooking the Baltic Sea)
                                            and is divided into the west side, the east side and the tip of the
                                            port. On the west side of the port is also the
                                            historical port, where there is the steamship Alexandra, one of the
                                            main symbols of Flensburg where inside there is also a
                                            ship museum. The proximity to the water was the economic
                                            reason for the founding of Flensburg.
                                            For centuries the port remained an important factor in the
                                            growth of the city, especially through trade.
                                            Initially the tip of the port was located much more towards the
                                            south, but due to geological phenomena such as silting,
                                            the tip has moved further north. Today, the port is still active with
                                            unloading and loading of goods, between Germany and Denmark. In addition to
                                            being the center of these commercial activities, the
                                            port is also a destination for many tourists, who can
                                            stroll along the quays, enjoy the view of the sea and
                                            see the cruise ships or eat something typical since the
                                            port also has restaurants and bars. In the port there are also
                                            different types of ships such as: sailing, classic
                                            yachts, steamships and motor ships. The port is connected to the
                                            old town of Flensburg, with its cobbled streets,
                                            shops, restaurants and historic buildings. Walking along the harbor,
                                            you can easily access these picturesque areas,
                                            which offer a combination of traditional architecture and local culture.

                                            can be removed, so that a variety of events can be

                                            is one of the main churches in Flensburg and is located in the
                                            most recent of the four old towns,
                                            near the town hall. The church is dedicated to Nikolaus von Myra and
                                            its construction began in 1390, then was put on hold and
                                            resumed in 1440. It is a
                                            church in Gothic style in brick, 52 meters long and 21 meters wide,
                                            composed of 3 naves and 7 bays. The
                                            bell tower is the tallest in Flensburg
                                            and one of the tallest in Schleswig-Holstein. The spire was rebuilt
                                            after it was destroyed by lightning in 1878. The church has a double
                                            organ, unique in the world for its shape.
                                            The church library was founded by Pastor Sebastian Schröder and is
                                            located above the south entrance,
                                            in its original position. The church is open every day of the
                                            week, offering a very wide time slot, making it a great place to
                                            visit if you are looking for places related to religion that have a history
                                            that goes back several

                                            Schleswig-Holstein.
                                            It was founded in 1876 and was used for exhibitions on the
                                            artistic and cultural history of the former Duchy of Schleswig.
                                            It consists of two palaces; the northern one has belonged to Denmark
                                            since 1920.
                                            The exhibition in the “Heinrich Sauermann House” illustrates the
                                            history of art and culture from 1500 to 1900. The original
                                            farmer’s living rooms and the collection of historical
                                            furniture, which numbers more than 900 pieces, is one of the
                                            largest of its kind in Germany.
                                            The exhibition of the "Hans Christiansen House" shows the art of
                                            Schleswig-Holstein
                                            from 1900 to 2000. The most important area is that of the Art Nouveau
                                            department with the main
                                            works of the painter Hans Christiansen, expressionist art thanks to the
                                            works of the painters Erich Heckel and Emil Nolde and the sculptor Emil
                                            Nolde, and finally contemporary
                                            art of the North. Special exhibitions with changing
                                            themes complement the permanent collection. We think it is an excellent
                                            tourist destination to come into contact with the history of German art of
                                            the
                                            last 500 years, being able to compare the works of

                                            Christiansen Park in Flensburg is one of the most picturesque
                                            places in the city, where natural beauty and local history
                                            come together. Located in the heart of Flensburg,
                                            the park is famous for its large gardens, long shaded
                                            paths and peaceful atmosphere.
                                            One of the most characteristic elements is the central pond, surrounded
                                            by a rich fauna that includes
                                            centuries-old trees and tamarisks. Here you can observe various animals such
                                            as:
                                            ducks and swans, making the park
                                            an ideal destination for families, nature lovers and those looking for a
                                            quiet place. The paths that branch off through the nearby
                                            meadows and woods offer various opportunities for walking, jogging or
                                            picnicking. The park is named after Christian Christiansen, a local
                                            philanthropist who helped to create it, and occasionally hosts
                                            cultural events, concerts and markets. Its central location makes it
                                            easily accessible, a perfect place to disconnect from the city routine and
                                            immerse yourself in the
                                            serenity of nature.

                                            St. Marien Kirche, is the oldest Lutheran-Evangelistic church located
                                            near the port of Flensburg.
                                            The church is characterized by numerous art treasures and impressive stained
                                            glass windows.
                                            In the basement, the figures of the apostles Peter and Paul are placed.
                                            Peter, on the left, holds in his hand
                                            the key to the kingdom of heaven, Paul carries as his attribute the sword,
                                            which can
                                            be seen as a sign of defense of the faith and also indicates his death by
                                            beheading.
                                            The main floor is divided into three pictorial fields, with the central
                                            field
                                            larger than the two sides
                                            and the main picture showing the Last Supper based on an engraving by
                                            Johann Sadeler.
                                            The two side surfaces each contain two medium-sized square
                                            pictures arranged one above the other, each of which is surrounded by a
                                            frame of 16
                                            small pictures. The upper floor
                                            is dominated by the painting of the Adoration of the Shepherds. It is
                                            flanked by two
                                            statues of women, the one on the left
                                            symbolizes hope with an anchor and a bird and the one on the right
                                            symbolizes faith with a cross and plaques
                                            of commandments. Numerous medieval artifacts dating back to the Gothic era
                                            have been preserved inside the church.

                                            these are all the objects in the museum that already in
                                            2000 started with private exhibitions about the rum of the
                                            distiller Walter Braasch. Year after year, the museum
                                            gained more popularity until at a certain point it was too small for the
                                            growing interest in the history of Flensburg rum. As a result, the
                                            Braasch family decided to renovate and expand the museum whose
                                            modern architecture blends almost invisibly with the historic walls. In
                                            July 2014, the museum was reopened
                                            by Walter and Karsten Braasch and since then it has offered an
                                            insight into the transatlantic triangular trade, the
                                            history of Flensburg rum and the production and manufacture of sugar and
                                            rum. The first part of the museum can be accessed through two
                                            courtyards, a corridor to the left of the house or directly through the
                                            shop. In the 2nd courtyard, a large world map
                                            welcomes you outside, which gives you a first overview of the
                                            West Indies trade. In the basement
                                            you learn how sugar was searched for and how rum was found.
                                            Here you can see a real distillery and learn about the
                                            "three små øer", the former Danish colonies. You will get an
                                            insight into the production of rum and the dark side of the
                                            transatlantic triangular trade. Finally, upstairs every 15 minutes we show
                                            pictures of a trip to today's US Virgin Islands – the islands of St. John,

                                            Alter Kaufmannhof is a building complex in one of the
                                            best preserved 18th-century Flensburg merchant courtyards. All
                                            the buildings were built around 1770; the facade was rebuilt at the
                                            beginning of the 19th century.
                                            The building was home to merchant families. On the
                                            north side was the kitchen, additional rooms and storage rooms. On the
                                            opposite side were the stables. To the east, the courtyard is
                                            surrounded by a warehouse built in 1716 with a passage system and
                                            elevator, in which there were further storage rooms and stables. The
                                            farm was home to one of the oldest schnapps distilleries in the
                                            city: the “Bommerlunder” was produced here for the
                                            first time. In 1974, the farm was in a very poor condition and
                                            largely unused. The transverse basin near the harbour was showing signs of
                                            serious subsidence. Although at the time

                                            the building was located outside the first
                                            area designated for the redevelopment of the old town of Flensburg,
                                            it was nevertheless decided to prepare for the renovation.
                                            In Denmark, there is a long and unbroken tradition of
                                            renovating old buildings. During the renovation of the
                                            Kaufmannshof in 1975-76, 12 apartments and a shop were created.
                                            The success of this first renovation of a large
                                            merchant farm had a positive effect on the ongoing urban
                                            renewal process in Flensburg. Thanks to
                                            this history, the Kaufmannshof has remained a landmark to this day, and is
                                            still a showcase for urban redevelopment.
